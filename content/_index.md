**Albert Einstein** was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. He is best known for developing the ***theory of relativity***, but he also made important contributions to the development of ***quantum mechanics***. Together ***relativity*** and ***quantum mechanics*** formed the two pillars of modern physics.

His ***mass–energy*** equivalence formula `E = mc²`, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed *"the world's most famous equation"*. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
 
He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics *"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"*, a pivotal step in the development of ***quantum theory***. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in *"Einstein"* becoming synonymous with *"genius"*. ***Einsteinium***, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.
