**Albert Einstein** was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. He is best known for developing the theory of `relativity`, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of `quantum mechanics` which form the two pillars of modern physics.

His _mass–energy_ equivalence formula `E = mc²`, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed _"the world's most famous equation"_. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
 
He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics _"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"_, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in _"Einstein"_ becoming synonymous with _"genius"_. _Einsteinium_, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.
